## 1. Hate Speech and Discrimination:
Content that promotes, condones, or perpetuates discrimination or hate speech against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or national origin is not allowed. The only exception where hate speech is acceptable is against scammers, which includes anyone how promotes shitcoins, including but not limited to Ethereum, Solana, BNB, XRP, Cardano and NFTs in general.

## 2. Harassment and Bullying:
We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of almost any kind. This includes, but is not limited to, threats, intimidation, unwanted sexual advances, stalking, and the sharing of private information (doxing). Again the only exception is regarding scammers as previously defined.

Posts that depict or glorify violence, or that are graphically violent or gory, are prohibited. This includes content that promotes or glorifies self-harm or suicide.

## 4. Illegal Activities:
Some content that promotes illegal activities, like terrorism and assassination of non-politicians. Activities usually considered illegal by the state like tax evasion, drug use/sale and anything related to firearms are not frowned upon and can be openly discussed here.

## 5. Misinformation and False News:
Who knows what is true anymore? We don't enforce any restriction against misinformation because we believe that open discussion is the best way to find the truth and change one's misguided opinions.

## 6. Intellectual Property Violations:
There is no such thing as Intellectual Property, you are free to share what you like as everything is derivative in some way.

## 7. Spam and Manipulative Behavior:
Content that is spammy in nature, including repetitive posting, manipulative link sharing, or schemes to artificially boost traffic or engagement, is prohibited.

Explicit content, including pornography or graphic sexual content, is not allowed. This also includes the sale or promotion of adult services.

## 9. Privacy Violations:
Posting or sharing content that violates someone elseâ€™s privacy, such as personal contact information, private communications, or intimate images without consent, is strictly forbidden.

## Enforcement:
Violation of these guidelines may result in content removal from the relay, a warning and seizure of your bitcoin collateral, depending on the severity and frequency of the violations.
